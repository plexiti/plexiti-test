                        <p><strong>A colorful animal</strong> walks on a flower meadow and meets a frog. The frog asks what kind of animal it is. But the small colorful animal does not know a good answer. So now it asks other animals (horses, fish, birds, hippos, parrots, dogs) if anyone knew who it was. But no one knows it. The little animal - increasingly desperate - finally asks: &ldquo;What if I do not exist at all?&rdquo; But then - all of a sudden - it is hit upon an idea. And the small colorful animal knows: &ldquo;Certainly - I exist: - <strong>I am me!</strong>&ldquo;</p>

<p>Even as a child I was a fan of the &ldquo;Little I-am-me&rdquo;! The well-known children&rsquo;s classic by <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Das-kleine-Ich-bin-ich/dp/3702658572">Mira Lobe and Susi Weigel</a> tells of a happy ending search for identity. And there I see striking parallels. Because if I am asked what I do for a living, I do often not have a good answer! I am neither a classic &ldquo;business analyst&rdquo; nor a classic &ldquo;software developer&rdquo;! And on bad days I ask myself whether I exist at all! <i class='fa fa-smile-o' aria-hidden='true'></i></p>

<p>I am deeply into many programming topics, usually much deeper than it is the case with most &ldquo;business analysts&rdquo;. On the other hand , I am somewhat less interested in the &ldquo;purely technical&rdquo; topics as it should be the case with &ldquo;software developers&rdquo;! Uptimes and reliable data exchange, scalability or performance optimisation is in my view better taken care of by those people who are fascinated by these subjects.</p>

<p>I am fascinated by those things that other software developers are sometimes less interested in than it could be the case. The <strong>business logic</strong> appeals to me, the <strong>inner purpose</strong> of software, even the economic justification for its existence. But then all the little <strong>functional (!) details</strong>, which when they happen to &ldquo;really work&rdquo; make software so valuable to the &ldquo;business&rdquo;. I get enthusiastic about automated test specifications as well as about modeling directly executable processes or preparing visualisations of statistical data for management. I work at my best, if I can talk with subject matter experts about their ideas directly and then not only describe what they need, but program it. As part of a development team, in the midst of those people who get excited about reliably reachable services, scalable systems and performing algorithms. And if I get along well with those people, I sometimes even write quite understandable documentation for them <i class='fa fa-smile-o' aria-hidden='true'></i>. (On my way, I will program the adjustments I need for the documentation site generator!)</p>

<p>I am me, quite definitely. But I also know that the world needs terms and concepts, in order to communicate well with each other. That&rsquo;s why I call myself today simply a <strong>business programmer</strong>. What&rsquo;s that all about? Oh well. Of course, all the stuff I am going to write about here!</p>
